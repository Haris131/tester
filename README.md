# OpenCode for Termux (Android aarch64)

Build system for cross-compiling [OpenCode](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode) to run natively on Android devices via [Termux](https://termux.dev/).

OpenCode is an AI-powered coding assistant for the terminal. It uses [Bun](https://bun.sh/) as its JavaScript runtime and compiles to a standalone binary via `bun build --compile`. Since Bun has no official Android support ([marked "not planned"](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/9)), this project cross-compiles Bun itself from source for Android/aarch64, including the full WebKit/JavaScriptCore engine.

## Install (Termux)

### Option 1: Standalone binary (easiest)

```bash
# Download and install
curl -LO https://github.com/Haris131/opencode-termux/releases/latest/download/opencode-aarch64.zip
unzip opencode-aarch64.zip
chmod +x opencode
mv opencode $PREFIX/bin/

# Install required dependency
pkg install ripgrep

# Run
opencode
```

### Option 2: Pacman package (recommended if using pacman)

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/Haris131/opencode-termux/releases/latest/download/opencode-aarch64.pkg.tar.xz
pacman -U opencode-*-aarch64.pkg.tar.xz
opencode
```

### Option 3: Deb package

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/Haris131/opencode-termux/releases/latest/download/opencode-aarch64.deb
dpkg -i opencode-*-aarch64.deb
opencode
```

The pacman and deb packages automatically install `ripgrep` as a dependency.

### After install

OpenCode needs an AI provider to work. Set one up by configuring your environment:

```bash
# Example: Use Anthropic Claude
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-..."

# Or use OpenAI
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."

# Then run
opencode
```

See the [OpenCode docs](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode) for full configuration options.

## What This Repo Contains

This repo contains **patch files and build scripts** only -- not the full source trees of Bun or WebKit (which are 1.1GB and 2.7GB respectively). The CI workflow clones upstream repos and applies patches during build.

## What Was Done

This project got OpenCode (a ~165MB standalone binary built on Bun + WebKit/JSC) running on Android/Termux, which required:

> **Updated to OpenCode v1.17.13** — Stable release.

1. **Cross-compiling Bun v1.3.14 for Android/aarch64** -- Bun has zero Android support. We patched 33+ files across the build system (CMake, Zig), syscall layer, Bionic libc compatibility, JSC/JIT configuration, and linker settings.

2. **Cross-compiling WebKit/JavaScriptCore for Android** -- No prebuilt WebKit exists for Android. We patched 5 files to replace glibc-specific APIs with POSIX/Android equivalents and fixed JIT signal handling for Android's security model.

3. **Fixing Zig's stdlib for Android/Bionic** -- Zig's `sigaction()` and `sigprocmask()` pass a 152-byte struct through Bionic's libc which expects 32 bytes, causing silent memory corruption. Patched to use raw syscalls on Android.

4. **Building libopentui.so for Android** -- OpenCode's TUI renderer depends on OpenTUI, which needed a patch to link Android NDK's libc.so stub so `dlopen()` can resolve symbols at runtime.

5. **Standalone binary surgery** -- Since `bun build --compile` has no Android cross-compilation target, we build a host standalone binary, extract the serialized module graph via the ELF `.bun` section header, and embed it onto the Android Bun binary as a **separate PT_LOAD segment** (not appending to RW segment). The PHT is extended from 8 to 9 entries.

6. **Cross-compiling ICU 75.1** -- Bun depends on ICU for Unicode/i18n support. Cross-compiled from source for Android.

7. **Cross-compiling TinyCC** -- Bun links against libtcc.a for FFI support. TinyCC's build system assumes a host build, so we cross-compile it separately and inject the library.

### Build pipeline
```

Stage 1: ICU 75.1          ~5 min    (cross-compile for Android)
Stage 2: WebKit/JSC        ~60-90 min (cross-compile, CACHED)
Stage 3: TinyCC            ~1 min    (cross-compile libtcc.a)
Stage 4: Bun binary        ~30-45 min (CMake + Ninja, CACHED)
Stage 5: libopentui.so     ~1 min    (Zig build for aarch64-linux-android)
Stage 6: OpenCode bundle   ~30 sec   (bun build --compile, extract module graph via ELF section, embed as separate PT_LOAD)
Stage 7: Packages          ~10 sec   (zip + pacman + deb)
```

With warm caches (WebKit + Bun cached), CI runs complete in ~6 minutes.

## Recent Fixes & Improvements

This section documents the fixes applied on top of the original `guysoft/opencode-termux` port to make OpenCode stable and crash-free on Termux/Android.

### Critical: SIGBUS crash (separate PT_LOAD for module graph)

**Root cause**: The module graph (~85 MB) was appended to the RW PT_LOAD, extending it from ~9 MB to ~94 MB. At exec time, the kernel split this large single mapping into 2-3 VMAs with a read-only gap. When the runtime tried to write to the gap (which was within the `p_filesz` range but mapped read-only by the kernel), it got SIGBUS at a constant address (`load_base + 0x5E20000`).

**Fix**: Instead of extending the existing RW PT_LOAD, add the module graph as a **new PT_LOAD segment** (flags = PF_R|PF_W, p_filesz == p_memsz). Since there's no zero-fill gap, the kernel maps it as a single VMA. The program header table is relocated to a gap within the first LOAD segment to accommodate the extra PHT entry (8 → 9 entries).

### Critical: TUI Effect.tryPromise (opentui arm64 not found)

**Root cause**: OpenCode's TUI uses `@opentui/core` which does a runtime `import("@opentui/core-linux-arm64")`. Bun's `bun build --compile` bundles platform-specific packages at build time based on the HOST architecture (x86_64), so only `@opentui/core-linux-x64-musl` gets embedded. The runtime import of `@opentui/core-linux-arm64` fails.

**Fix**: After `bun install`, create a synthetic `@opentui/core-linux-arm64` package directory in Bun's virtual store, copied from the x64 variant with fixed `package.json` (name, cpu fields). Also create a `node_modules/@opentui/core-linux-arm64` symlink so Bun's resolver finds it during bundling.

### Critical: TinyCC FFI disabled ("dlopen not available")

**Root cause**: Bun's `scripts/build/config.ts` explicitly disables TinyCC for Android targets (`abi === "android"`). Even though `libtcc.a` is linked into the binary, the `Environment.enable_tinycc` compile-time flag is false, causing `bun:ffi` (dlopen, cc, callback) to fail with "TinyCC is disabled".

**Fix**: Added `--tinycc=true` flag to the Bun configure step (`build-bun.sh`), overriding the default disable for Android.

### Critical: CI build failure (llvm-strip multi-input with -o)

**Root cause**: The CI symlinks NDK's `llvm-strip` to `/usr/local/bin/strip` for Android ELF support. Bun's ninja build calls `strip --strip-all --strip-debug --discard-all bun-profile android_tls.a libtcc.a -o bun`. GNU strip supports multi-input with `-o`, but llvm-strip does not.

**Fix**: Install a strip wrapper script BEFORE the Bun build. The wrapper parses the arguments, skips flag arguments starting with `-`, and only strips the first positional argument (the actual binary `bun-profile`) using llvm-strip. Extra `.a` files are ignored.

### Critical: OOM on startup (Module graph stride mismatch)

**Root cause**: `CompiledModuleGraphFile` is 36 bytes across Bun versions. The original patch added `_pad1`/`_pad2`/`_pad3` fields that bloated the Zig struct to 52 bytes, causing `bytesAsSlice()` to read module entries at 52-byte stride while the host wrote them at 36-byte stride. This produced garbage `StringPointer` values → huge allocations → RSS jumped to 1GB+ → OOM killed by Android kernel.

**Fix**: Removed the bogus padding fields. The struct now matches the native 36-byte layout. The `Offsets` struct was extended to 32 bytes (adding `compile_exec_argv_ptr`) to match the host v1.3.14 header format.

### Critical: OpenTUI `@intCast` panic in streaming renderer

**Root cause**: OpenTUI's `renderer.zig` casts `cell.attributes` (a `u32` containing 8 base attribute bits + 24-bit link_id) to `i32` via `@as(i32, @intCast(...))`. In `ReleaseSafe` mode, Zig's runtime safety checks panic when the value exceeds `INT32_MAX`. This occurred during streaming TUI output when TUI_TARGET set to `basic`.

**Fix**: Build `libopentui.so` with Zig `ReleaseFast` optimization mode (commit `b2a594c`), which removes runtime safety checks from OpenTUI. This is a pragmatic fix over patching upstream OpenTUI source.

### Critical: Module graph Offsets struct size

The module graph header (`Offsets`) written by the host Bun v1.3.14 is 32 bytes:
- `byte_count: u64` (8)
- `modules_ptr: StringPointer` (8)
- `entry_point_id: u32` (4)
- `compile_exec_argv_ptr: StringPointer` (8)
- padding (4, for 8-byte alignment)

The extraction script (`build-opencode-android.ts`) must use `OFFSETS_SIZE = 32` to locate the module graph at the correct offset. Earlier attempts used 20 bytes and 28 bytes, both causing the footer to be misread.

### Debug build fixes

`CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` adds `-O0` + `-fsanitize` flags that break C++ cross-compilation (template expansion failures with `-O0`). The correct configuration is:
- `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo` (for C/C++: `-O2 -g`)
- `-DZIG_OPTIMIZE=Debug` (forces Zig optimization to Debug independently)

### CI workflow reliability

- `apt-get update` wrapped in `timeout 120` retry loop (3 attempts) to handle network flakiness
- Job timeout increased from default to 480 minutes
- Debug/release build flags included in GitHub Actions cache keys so debug and release builds use separate caches

### $TMPDIR respect on Android/Termux

`platformTempDir()` in `src/fs.zig` previously skipped `$TMPDIR`/`$TMP` environment variable checks on Android because `Environment.isLinux` is `false` (Android uses `.android` ABI). Added `Environment.isAndroid` check so Termux's `$TMPDIR` is respected instead of falling back to unwritable `/tmp/`. Also fixed `ModuleLoader.zig` which hardcoded `/tmp/bun-debug-src/` for non-Windows.

### EACCES directory handling in resolver

On Android/Termux, directories like `/` (root) and certain FUSE mount points may be inaccessible (EACCES) for directory listing. The resolver needed multiple iterations to handle this:

1. Skip root path errors via labeled block (`root_handle:`) with `break`
2. Skip EACCES during queue processing via `markNotFound` + `continue`
3. Work around Zig codegen bugs: `continue` inside `else |err| switch` triggers a Zig compiler crash. Workaround: use `else |err| { if chain }` pattern and extract `should_skip` outside the `if/else` block
4. Final approach: `access()` check before `open_dir` to avoid the error entirely

### Zig compatibility

### Patch system improvements

- Added `git clean -fd` before re-applying patches to remove stale build artifacts
- Regenerated `StandaloneModuleGraph.zig` hunk with correct context boundaries (indentation match)
- Split patch into proper hunks with matching source context lines

---

### What was patched and why

The `opencode-termux` patches are organized by component:

## What Was Patched and Why

### Bun Patches (35+ files modified, 4 new files)

Bun has zero Android support. Every patch falls into one of these categories:

#### Build system (CMake/Zig)
- **Android NDK CMake toolchain** (`cmake/toolchains/android-aarch64.cmake`) -- new file. Sets up cross-compiler, sysroot, and find-root paths for the entire Bun build.
- **`-fPIC` instead of `-fno-pic`** -- Android requires position-independent code for all executables and shared libraries (since API 21).
- **PIE linking** -- Android mandates position-independent executables. Changed `-Wl,-no-pie` to `-pie -fPIE`.
- **Rust linker set to NDK's versioned clang** -- The lol-html Rust crate must link against Android's libc, not the host's. Set `CARGO_TARGET_AARCH64_LINUX_ANDROID_LINKER` to the NDK's `aarch64-linux-android24-clang`.
- **Zig `translate-c` given NDK sysroot headers** -- Zig has no bundled Android libc headers. Added `-Dandroid-ndk-sysroot` build option that passes NDK include paths to `translate-c`.
- **`-Wno-undefined-var-template`** added -- NDK Clang 19 triggers this warning on some JSC template specializations; with `-Werror`, this becomes a build failure.
- **RELRO kept enabled** -- Desktop Linux disables RELRO (`-Wl,-z,norelro`); Android requires it for security.
- **`CARGO_ENCODED_RUSTFLAGS` replaced with `RUSTFLAGS`** -- CMake can't encode the 0x1F separator that `CARGO_ENCODED_RUSTFLAGS` requires. Switched to space-separated `RUSTFLAGS`.

#### TLS alignment (ARM64 Bionic critical fix)
- **`android_tls_align.s`** -- new file. Assembly file that creates a `.tbss` section with 64-byte alignment. Without this, the Zig linker emits `PT_TLS p_align=8`, causing TLS variables to overlap with Bionic's Thread Control Block slots (TPIDR+0..63), corrupting scudo allocator state and crashing on first allocation. This MUST be assembled (not compiled as C) to avoid NDK's emulated TLS (`__emutls`).
- **`android_tls_align.c`** -- backup C version with `__attribute__((aligned(64)))`.

#### Syscall compatibility
- **`close_range()` fallback** -- Android's seccomp filter blocks the `close_range` syscall in app processes (including Termux). Replaced with iteration over `/proc/self/fd`.
- **`preadv2`/`pwritev2` return ENOSYS** -- These syscalls may be blocked by Android's seccomp. Return ENOSYS so the Zig caller falls back to regular `read()`/`write()`.
- **`epoll_pwait2` return ENOSYS** -- Same seccomp issue. Falls back to `epoll_pwait`.
- **`lchmod` return ENOSYS** -- Not available in Bionic.

#### Bionic libc differences
- **`memmem`, `lstat`, `fstat`, `stat` as `@extern` declarations** -- Bionic has these symbols but Zig's `translate-c` doesn't pick them up due to symbol visibility differences. Declared manually.
- **`getifaddrs`/`freeifaddrs` extern wrappers** -- Hidden by `__INTRODUCED_IN` macros at API 24 despite being available. Declared manually via `@extern`.
- **`pthread_setcancelstate` stubbed** -- Bionic has no POSIX thread cancellation.
- **`posix_spawnattr_setsigdefault`/`setsigmask` stubbed** -- Require API 28, we target API 24. Bun uses its own `posix_spawn_bun()` which handles signals directly.
- **No separate `-lpthread`** -- Bionic merges pthread into libc. Removed from link flags.
- **`pwrite64` not used on Android** -- Android/Bionic uses standard `pwrite`, not the glibc compat symbol.
- **`open()` flag fix** -- Removed third argument (mode) from `open()` call when not creating a file (Bionic is stricter about this).

#### JSC/JIT fixes
- **Signal-based VM traps disabled** (`usePollingTraps=true`) -- Android's `debuggerd` crash handler intercepts SIGSEGV before the app's signal handler, so JSC's signal-based traps crash the process instead of being caught.
- **Wasm fault signal handler disabled** (`useWasmFaultSignalHandler=false`) -- Same `debuggerd` issue. Uses explicit bounds checking instead.
- **Options set via `setenv("JSC_*")` BEFORE `JSC::initialize()`** -- `Options::initialize()` resets all options to defaults before reading env vars. Setting options via the API before `initialize()` has no effect.

#### Standalone binary format
- **`StandaloneModuleGraph.zig` Offsets struct extended** -- Added `compile_exec_argv_ptr`, `flags` fields and `Flags` type to match the format produced by host Bun 1.3.2.
- **`find()` function bug fix** -- Fixed variable name from `base_path` to `name` in `isBunStandaloneFilePath()` call (this was actually an upstream bug).

#### Platform detection
- **`isAndroid` constant** added to `env.zig` -- `isLinux and abi == .android`.
- **`isMusl` excludes Android** -- Android uses Bionic, not musl.
- **`bun upgrade` disabled on Android** -- No Android release channel exists.
- **Crash handler**: Enhanced with aarch64 register dump and `/proc/self/maps` output for debugging crashes on Android.
- **File descriptor limit**: Raised on Android (like musl) since Termux has low defaults.
- **npm libc detection**: Reports as `glibc` for package resolution compatibility.

#### Other
- **Post-build test skip** -- CMake tries to run `bun --revision` after linking; can't run aarch64 binary on x86_64 host. Added `if(NOT ANDROID)` guard.
- **`features.json` skip** -- Same issue; generation requires running the binary.
- **CI artifact naming** -- Uses `bun-android-aarch64` triplet.

### WebKit Patches (5 files)

- **`bcmp` replaced with `memcmp`** -- `bcmp` is BSD, not available in Bionic's `libpas`.
- **`aligned_alloc` replaced with `posix_memalign`** -- `aligned_alloc` requires API 28, we target API 24.
- **`backtrace()` stubbed** -- Requires API 33.
- **`pthread_getname_np` stubbed** -- Requires API 26.
- **JSC `InitializeThreading.cpp`** -- Force polling traps and disable Wasm signal handler on Android (same rationale as Bun patches).

### Zig Stdlib Patch (1 file)

- **`sigaction()` and `sigprocmask()` bypass Bionic libc** -- Bionic's `struct sigaction` is 32 bytes with 8-byte `sigset_t`, but Zig's `linux.Sigaction` is 152 bytes with 128-byte `sigset_t`. Passing Zig's struct through Bionic's `sigaction()` causes silent memory corruption. The patch makes these functions use raw `rt_sigaction`/`rt_sigprocmask` syscalls on Android, which correctly handle the kernel's struct layout.

### OpenTUI Patch (1 file)

- **Link NDK `libc.so` stub** -- On Android, the `.so` must have `NEEDED: libc.so` in its ELF headers so `dlopen()` can resolve symbols like `getauxval`. Zig doesn't bundle Android libc, so we directly add the NDK sysroot's `libc.so` stub as a link input.

---

## How the Standalone Binary Works

Since `bun build --compile` has no Android cross-compilation target, we use a manual approach:

1. Use **host Bun (v1.3.14)** to `bun build --compile` OpenCode for the host platform
2. Extract the serialized **module graph** from the host standalone binary by locating the ELF `.bun` section header
3. Patch the module graph in-place (fix `undici` global reference)
4. Before bundling, swap x86_64 `libopentui.so` with the ARM64 Android-built version, so it gets embedded in the module graph
5. Embed the module graph into our **Android Bun** binary as a **new PT_LOAD segment** (instead of extending the existing RW PT_LOAD)

The standalone binary format:
```
[Android Bun binary (~96 MB)]
  ─ First PT_LOAD (R/X):  ELF header + code
  ─ Second PT_LOAD (R/W): data + RELA table (unchanged, ~1.7 MB)
  ─ ...
  ─ New PT_LOAD (R/W):    RELA table (53 entries) + module graph (~85 MB)
                          (modifies DT_RELA/DT_RELASZ, adds RELATIVE relocation)
```

### Why the module graph uses a separate PT_LOAD

Earlier approach extended the existing RW PT_LOAD from ~9 MB to ~94 MB. At exec time, the kernel split this large mapping into 2-3 VMAs with a read-only gap, causing SIGBUS (~10% of runs). Using a separate PT_LOAD with `p_filesz == p_memsz` (no zero-fill gap) avoids kernel splitting and the SIGBUS crash.

The program header table is relocated to a gap address (`0x15480`) within the first LOAD segment to accommodate the extra PHT entry (9 total: 8 original + 1 new).

### Why host and target Bun versions must match

Host Bun (used for `bun build --compile`) and target Android Bun (the runtime binary) must be **the same version** (v1.3.14). This ensures:
1. The `CompiledModuleGraphFile` entry stride (36 bytes) and `Offsets` header (32 bytes) are identical
2. The module graph format is compatible
3. Both support `catalog:` workspace protocol (needed by OpenCode)

The `Offsets` struct header format:
- `byte_count: u64` (8)
- `modules_ptr: StringPointer` (8)
- `entry_point_id: u32` (4)
- `compile_exec_argv_ptr: StringPointer` (8)
- padding (4, for 8-byte alignment)

Total: **32 bytes** (`OFFSETS_SIZE = 32`).

## Known Issues

### Working
- Full TUI rendering (ASCII art logo, prompt, model selector, status bar)
- All backend services (server, provider, file watcher, LSP)
- `opencode --version` outputs correct version
- AI provider connections (tested with Claude, GitHub Copilot)
- No crashes, panics, or OOM on startup or during normal operation

### Resolved Issues

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| OOM on startup (1GB RSS, killed by kernel) | Removed bogus `_pad1`/`_pad2`/`_pad3` padding from `CompiledModuleGraphFile` — struct is 36 bytes in both Bun versions, not 52 |
| `@intCast` panic in TUI renderer | Built `libopentui.so` with `ReleaseFast` instead of `ReleaseSafe` |
| Module graph parse failure | Fixed `Offsets` struct size to 32 bytes (matching host v1.3.14 header format) |
| SIGBUS crash (0x2800000101) | Module graph embedded as separate PT_LOAD segment instead of extending RW PT_LOAD to 94 MB |
| TUI Effect.tryPromise error (opentui arm64 not found) | Created synthetic `@opentui/core-linux-arm64` package + `node_modules` symlink for Bun.build() resolution |
| CI build failure (llvm-strip multi-input + -o) | Strip wrapper script handles Bun's ninja multi-input strip command |
| TinyCC FFI disabled ("dlopen not available") | Added `--tinycc=true` flag to Bun configure step (officially disabled for Android) |
| Worker postMessage crash (TUI thread) | `OPENCODE_WORKER_PATH` define uses `.ts` path matching entrypoint, not `.js` |
| ARM64 .so bundled as x86_64 | Swapped ARM64 libopentui.so + watcher.node into `@opentui/core-linux-x64-musl` and `@parcel/watcher-linux-x64-glibc` packages |
| Debug build failure | Use `RelWithDebInfo` + `-DZIG_OPTIMIZE=Debug` instead of `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` |
| `CompressionStream` is not defined | Added polyfill via `node:zlib` sync APIs |
| Hardlink `EXDEV` on `bun install` | Default Android install backend changed to `copyfile` |
| Read-only filesystem errors | Respect `$TMPDIR` instead of hardcoded `/tmp/` |
| EACCES directory scanner crashes | Multiple resolver fixes for inaccessible directories on Termux |
| Zig 0.15 `@truncate` compile errors | Updated syntax for Zig 0.15.2 |

### Not working / degraded

| Issue | Severity | Details |
|-------|----------|---------|
| File watcher native module | Low | `@parcel/watcher` `.node` binding uses libstdc++/glibc unavailable on Bionic. Compiled binary `dlopen` cannot load `.node` from `$bunfs` virtual FS. `fs.watch`-based shim in testing. Falls back gracefully to polling. |
| `bun upgrade` | Low | Disabled on Android -- no Android release channel exists upstream |
| SIGPWR signals | None | Many SIGPWR signals appear in strace -- related to Android's power management or Bun's signal handling. Not errors. |
| Worker thread with native FFI | Low | Bun's Worker + dlopen from virtual FS may crash on postMessage. TUI mini mode works around this by running single-threaded. |

### Workarounds in use

| Workaround | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| Host Bun pinned to 1.3.14 | Must match target Bun version for compatible module graph format + support `catalog:` workspace protocol |
| Module graph as separate PT_LOAD segment | Extending the RW PT_LOAD to 94 MB causes kernel to split mapping (creating read-only gap). Separate segment avoids the issue. |
| Strip wrapper for multi-input llvm-strip | Bun's ninja build calls `strip bun-profile a.a b.a -o bun` but llvm-strip doesn't support multiple inputs with `-o` |
| `close_range()` replaced with `/proc/self/fd` iteration | Android seccomp blocks the `close_range` syscall in app processes |
| `preadv2`/`pwritev2`/`epoll_pwait2` return ENOSYS | Seccomp may block these; callers fall back gracefully |
| `setenv("JSC_*")` before `JSC::initialize()` | Options API is reset during initialization; env vars survive the reset |
| `.tbss` section with 64-byte alignment in assembly | Forces `PT_TLS p_align=64` to avoid corrupting Bionic's TCB slots |
| Raw `rt_sigaction`/`rt_sigprocmask` syscalls | Zig's struct layout doesn't match Bionic's; bypass libc entirely |
| NDK `libc.so` stub linked into `libopentui.so` | Zig doesn't provision Android libc; explicit link needed for `dlopen` symbol resolution |
| Module graph extracted via ELF section, not trailer | Trailer-based extraction breaks if `llvm-strip` truncates file. Use ELF `.bun` section instead. |
| OpenTUI built with `ReleaseFast` | Avoids `u32→i32` @intCast safety panic in renderer when attribute values exceed INT32_MAX |
| `OFFSETS_SIZE = 32` in extraction script | Host Bun v1.3.14 writes 32-byte Offsets header; must match for correct module graph parsing |
| `fs.watch` shim for @parcel/watcher | Native .node addon can't `dlopen` from `$bunfs` virtual filesystem. Shim uses Bun's built-in `fs.watch` (inotify backend). |

## Upstream PR Opportunities

These patches could potentially be contributed upstream to reduce the maintenance burden of this project.

### Bun (oven-sh/bun) -- Partial upstreaming possible

The Bun team [closed Android support as "not planned"](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/9). However, some patches are clean improvements regardless of Android:

| Patch | Upstreamable? | Notes |
|-------|:---:|-------|
| `StandaloneModuleGraph.zig` `find()` bug fix (`base_path` -> `name`) | Yes | This is an actual bug in upstream Bun |
| `CARGO_ENCODED_RUSTFLAGS` -> `RUSTFLAGS` | Maybe | Simpler, avoids CMake 0x1F encoding issues. May have side effects on other platforms. |
| `open()` mode argument fix in `bsd.c` | Yes | Passing a mode to `open()` without `O_CREAT` is technically undefined behavior |
| Android CMake toolchain + `if(ANDROID)` guards | No | Team has explicitly declined Android support |
| Syscall fallbacks (`close_range`, `preadv2`, etc.) | No | Only needed on Android |
| Bionic libc stubs (`pthread_setcancelstate`, etc.) | No | Only needed on Android |
| TLS alignment fix | No | Only needed for Android/aarch64 Bionic |
| JSC signal trap changes | No | Only needed on Android due to debuggerd |
| `isAndroid` environment detection | No | Only needed on Android |

**Recommendation**: Submit a small PR with the `find()` bug fix and the `open()` mode fix. These are correctness improvements that benefit all platforms. The rest is Android-specific and will be rejected per Bun team policy.

### WebKit (oven-sh/WebKit) -- Unlikely

| Patch | Upstreamable? | Notes |
|-------|:---:|-------|
| `bcmp` -> `memcmp` | Maybe | `memcmp` is more portable, but oven-sh may not care since they only target macOS/Linux/Windows |
| `aligned_alloc` -> `posix_memalign` | No | Only needed for Android API < 28 |
| `backtrace()` stub | No | Only needed for Android API < 33 |
| `pthread_getname_np` stub | No | Only needed for Android API < 26 |
| Polling traps + Wasm signal handler | No | Only needed on Android |

**Recommendation**: The `bcmp` -> `memcmp` change is the only candidate, but it's unlikely to be accepted since oven-sh/WebKit is a Bun-specific fork. Not worth the effort.

### Zig (oven-sh/zig) -- Should be upstreamed

| Patch | Upstreamable? | Notes |
|-------|:---:|-------|
| `sigaction`/`sigprocmask` Android bypass | Yes | This is a real bug: Zig's POSIX layer corrupts memory on Android/Bionic due to struct size mismatch |

**Recommendation**: This should be submitted to upstream Zig (ziglang/zig), not just oven-sh/zig. The struct layout mismatch between Zig's `Sigaction` (152 bytes) and Bionic's `struct sigaction` (32 bytes) is a genuine bug that affects any Zig program targeting Android. The fix (using raw syscalls on Android) is clean and correct.

**Note**: oven-sh/zig is Bun's custom Zig fork (v0.14.0), not upstream Zig. The patch should be adapted for current Zig master as well.

### OpenTUI (anomalyco/opentui) -- Should be upstreamed

| Patch | Upstreamable? | Notes |
|-------|:---:|-------|
| NDK libc.so stub linking for Android | Yes | Clean, conditionally compiled, needed for any Android target |

**Recommendation**: Submit a PR to `anomalyco/opentui`. The patch correctly detects Android targets in `build.zig` and links the NDK's `libc.so` stub only when targeting `aarch64-linux-android`. It's a small, self-contained change that enables Android support without affecting other targets.

### What will never make it upstream

- **Bun Android support as a whole** -- The Bun team has explicitly declined this. The CMake toolchain, all `if(ANDROID)` guards, syscall fallbacks, Bionic stubs, and TLS alignment fix are permanent patches we'll need to maintain for every Bun version bump.
- **WebKit Android patches** -- oven-sh/WebKit only supports macOS/Linux/Windows. No incentive to accept Android-specific changes.
- **Host Bun version pinning** -- This is a build-time constraint, not a code patch. It will need to be re-evaluated with each Bun version bump (checking if the `CompiledModuleGraphFile` struct changed).
- **Standalone binary surgery** (module graph extraction + transplant) -- This entire approach is a workaround for the lack of cross-compilation in `bun build --compile`. If Bun ever adds cross-compile targets, this becomes unnecessary.
